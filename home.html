	<h2>What's this</h2>
	<p>
		ApolloGeese represents a design philosophy, a collection of essential web-application back-end modules and <i>one</i> sexy language.
	</p>
	<p>
		The current proof-of-concept implementation has been done in Mono C#. This means that you can use this neato fresh software stack on pretty much any platform. Without recompiling.
	</p>

<div class="detaroced bar">

	<h2>Design philosophy</h2>
	<p>
		In any given software design, more than 90% of the program flow consists of merely a handful of similar elements chained together in a hierarchical fashion, exchanging typically trivial amounts of information.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can use this knowledge to develop a simpler, quicker way of creating software than we're used to from conventional development platforms such as Python, PHP and ASP.Net. This development-time speedboost could be achieved while imposing only some minor, creative limitations on developers.
	</p>
	<p>
		We'd have to decide upon a protocol outlining the behavior and structure of non-distinct elements in software, and a protocol outlining the communication between those elements.
	</p>
	<p>
		For ApolloGeese, precisely this has been done; non-distinct elements will be referred to as <b>Services</b>, communication between <b>Services</b> is done by means of <b>Interactions</b>
	</p>
</div>
<div class="even bar">
	<div class="blank half">		
		<h3>Services</h3>
		<p>
			Services expose:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A Description of the service, wherein they aptly describe their purpose in relation to their current situation within a program flow.
			</li>
			<li>
				A single entry point used to provide the service with context by means of an Interaction originating from hierarchically upstream services.
			</li>
			<li>
				Multiple named exit points used to propagate richer context by means of (new) Interactions to hierarchically downstream services.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="blank half">
		<h3>Interactions</h3>
		<p>
			Interactions expose:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Means to store information on a key-value basis, including nested key-value stores. (Though admittedly,	don't you dare to even consider it)
			</li>
			<li>
				Means to access ancestral Interactions; Interactions that have triggered the creation of the current one.
			</li>
			<li>
				Means to access information stored on both the current and ancestral Interactions.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Modules</h2>
	<p>
		Well over twenty modules and have already been developed in accordance to this philosophy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Below, six modules most relevant to web development have been highlighted:
	</p>
</div>
<div class="blank even bar">
	<div class="third">
		<h3>HTTP Server</h3>
		<p>
			Listens on one or multiple ports and prefixes for incoming HTTP requests and creates a context wherein an URL-queue, header-data and body-data exist.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third">
		<h3>SiteSubsection</h3>
		<p>
			Uses the URL-queue from existing context to deviate into an appropriate branch of the program flow. Enriches the context with the current URL-section name.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third">
		<h3>Template</h3>
		<p>
			Uses either existing context or underlying branches to fill in template gaps.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="blank even bar">
	<div class="third">
		<h3>GetFieldReader</h3>
		<p>
			Parses the query-section of the url (after the question mark), verifies this input and branches onwards depending whether or not verification was successful. It enriches the context with the parsed and sanitized input.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third">
		<h3>PostFieldReader</h3>
		<p>
			Shares many traits with the <b>GetFieldReader</b>, but instead parses and verifies the HTML POST-body into context.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third">
		<h3>MySqlQuerier</h3>
		<p>
			Uses values from context to fill in a parameterized query. It branches for each result, enriching context with acquired row values.
		</p>

	<h2>Tying it together</h2>
	<p>
		We now have a philosophy, and a handful of very useful modules, but no means to tie them together other than Mono-languages. And let's be fair: the temptation to deviate from the design philosophy would soon be too great with such a complex language.				
	</p>	
	<p>
		Furthermore, the Mono/.NET languages would serve a problem too so soon as (I failed to mention this earlier) the <i>actual</i> implementation is done in C.
	</p>		
	<p>
		So I proudly present you:
	</p>	
	<h2>CLON - The language</h2>
	<p>
		Because the correct answer to the question "Should I make my product sound like a spaceship or an STD?" can and should only be "Both".
	</p>
	<p>
		CLON is short for 'C-Like Object Notation'. That's because it looks a little like C, but it notates objects. It can define a flow of operation without conditionals, but shares syntactical traits with JSON otherwise. That means it's hierarchical and blows curly-ass brackets all over the place.
	</p>
	<p>
		I will now explicitly restate that CLON is merely an 'Object Notation'. It is not a programming language. If you dare to claim otherwise, I dare you to make a turing machine in it. (Instructing ApolloGeese to behave like a Turing machine doesn't count, ew.)
	</p>
	<p>
		As advertised, CLON may be used to string Services together, such as but not limited to the above defined ones. Like so:
	</p>
	<p class="code">
		{% example %}
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the file that is currently defining this very page; syntax-highlighted on the spot and cached since the last modification. Now that's open source.
