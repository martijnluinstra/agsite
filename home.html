	<h2>What's this</h2>
	<p>
		ApolloGeese represents a design philosophy, a collection of essential web-application back-end modules and <i>one</i> sexy language.
	</p>
	<p>
		The current proof-of-concept implementation has been done in Mono C#, which makes it quite portable.
	</p>

	<h2>Design philosophy</h2>
	<p>
		In any given software design, more than 90% of the program flow consists of merely a handful of similar elements chained together in a hierarchical fashion, exchanging typically trivial amounts of information.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can use this knowledge to develop a simpler, quicker way of creating software than we're used to from conventional development platforms such as Python, PHP and ASP.Net. This development-time speedboost could be achieved while imposing only some minor, creative limitations on developers.
	</p>
	<p>
		We'd have to decide upon a protocol outlining the behavior and structure of non-distinct elements in software, and a protocol outlining the communication between those elements.
	</p>
	<p>
		For ApolloGeese, precisely this has been done; non-distinct elements will be referred to as <b>Services</b>, communication between <b>Services</b> is done by means of <b>Interactions</b>
	</p>
</div>
<div class="even bar">
	<div class="blank half">		
		<h3>Services</h3>
		<p>
			Services are the active components within a software system and expose:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Means of initial configuration through a constructor-like call.
			</li>
			<li>
				A single entry point used to activate the service and provide it with context produced by hierarchically upstream services.
			</li>
			<li>
				Multiple named exit points used to propagate richer context by means of (new) Interactions to hierarchically downstream services.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="blank half">
		<h3>Interactions</h3>
		<p>
			Interactions are exchanged within a hierarchy of services and provide:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Means to store information on a key-value basis, including nested key-value stores. (Though admittedly,	don't you dare to even consider it)
			</li>
			<li>
				Means to access ancestral Interactions; Interactions that have triggered the creation of the current one.
			</li>
			<li>
				Means to access information stored on both the current and ancestral Interactions.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Modules</h2>
	<p>
		Well over forty modules have already been developed adhering to the Service/Interaction philosophy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Below, six modules most relevant to web development have been highlighted:
	</p>
</div>
<div class="blank even bar">
	<div class="third">
		<h3>HTTP Server</h3>
		<p>
			Listens on one or multiple ports and prefixes for incoming HTTP requests and creates a context upon each request, wherein an URL-queue, header-data and body-data exist.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third">
		<h3>SiteSubsection</h3>
		<p>
			Uses the URL information from existing context to deviate into an appropriate branch of the program flow. Enriches the context with the current URL-section name. So, between the slashes.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third">
		<h3>Template</h3>
		<p>
			Uses either existing context or underlying branches to fill in template labels.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="blank even bar">
	<div class="third">
		<h3>GetFieldReader</h3>
		<p>
			Parses the query-section of the URL (after the '?'), verifies this input and branches onwards depending whether or not verification was successful. It enriches the context with the parsed and sanitized input.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third">
		<h3>PostFieldReader</h3>
		<p>
			Shares many traits with the <b>GetFieldReader</b>, but instead parses and verifies the HTML POST-body into context.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third">
		<h3>MySqlQuerier</h3>
		<p>
			Uses values from context to fill in a parameterized query. It branches for single results, each result, and no results. It enriches context with acquired row values, if any.
		</p>

	<h2>Tying it together</h2>
	<p>
		We now have a philosophy, and a handful of very useful modules, but no means to tie them together other than Mono-languages they were made in. And let's be fair: the temptation to deviate from the design philosophy would soon be too great with a more general purpose programming language.				
	</p>	
	<p>
		Furthermore, the Mono/.NET languages would serve a problem too so soon as (I failed to mention this earlier) the <i>actual</i> implementation is done in C.
	</p>		
	<p>
		So I proudly present you:
	</p>	
	<h2>CLON - The language</h2>
	<p>
		Because the correct answer to the question "Should I make my product sound like a spaceship or an STD?" can and should only be "Both".
	</p>
	<p>
		CLON is short for 'C-Like Object Notation'. That's because it looks a little like C, but it notates objects. It can define a flow of operation without conditionals, but shares syntactical traits with JSON otherwise. That means it's hierarchical and blows curly-ass brackets all over the place.
	</p>
	<p>
		As advertised, CLON may be used to string Services together, such as but not limited to the above defined ones. Like so:
	</p>
	<p class="code">
		{% example %}
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the file that is currently defining this very page; syntax-highlighted on the spot and cached since the last modification. Now that's open source.
