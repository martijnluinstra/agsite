<h1>Getting started with ApolloGeese and CLON</h1>
<h2>Preparing your system</h2>
<p>
	On Windows, the .NET framework is required. Given you're running a fairly
	recent Windows version (such as Windows 7), and you politely let your monthly software updates happen, you have this.
</p>
<p>
	On UNIX (Linux, BSD, OSX, etc.), you can use Mono. The build we're using
	has been tested using Mono version 3.2.8. Later versions should work fine,
	earlier versions might not. On Debian-based Linux-distributions you may
	install mono using the command <span class="monospace">apt-get install mono-runtime</span>, or <span class="monospace">apt-get install mono-complete</span> if you feel like tinkering with the inner workings of ApolloGeese.
</p>
<p>
	To fully utilize the software package, you'll need a MySQL server install. MariaDB is fine too. I won't do any statements on whether or not it'll do PostegreSQL, but I reckon it could.
</p>
<h2>Acquiring 'the package'</h2>
<p>
	You may acquire the most recent release of ApolloGeese on github, along
	with the source package. The most recent release at the time of writing this
	is <a href="https://github.com/strandtentje/apollogeese/releases/tag/v0.4">pre-release v0.4</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Extract the package and navigate to the freshly made directory. Notice how there's an executable called 'Geese.exe', a bunch of dll's, an index.html and apollogeese.conf. The latter two are example files.
</p>
<h2>Configuring pt. 1</h2>
<p>
	You may skip this section if you don't have any other (development) servers running on your system, on port 8080.
</p>
<p>
	The default configuration of ApolloGeese creates a debug server on port
	8080. If this is not to your likings, you may modify this setting in 
	apollogeese.conf.
</p>
<p>
	Just halfway the file you will see a line saying 'prefixes = ["http://*:8080/"]' - this means apollogeese will spew out whatever it's told to spew out at any (*) domain name, on port 8080.
</p>
<p>
	Modify this to another port and optionally domain so apollogeese can be run side-by-side with your existing development stacks.
</p>
<h2>Running apollogeese</h2>
<p>
	On Windows you may simply double-click Geese.exe. It will spawn a terminal window and start producing a log. Closing this window closes the server, too.
</p>
<p>
	On UNIX, assuming you have mono installed, use a terminal to execute the command <span class="monospace">mono Geese.exe</span>. It will start producing some log information. Ctrl-C'ing out of this will terminate the server. You may run apollogeese in a tmux or screen session for some of that faux daemon goodness.
</p>
<h2>Testing apollogeese</h2>
<p>
	Open your webbrowser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>, or the alternative domain+port combination you've configured.
</p>
<p>
	If you see a page announcing that it is in fact, alive, with a rather ominous 'exquisite', then you're all set to start making things in apollogeese!
