<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>
	I've attempted to write these instructions in a relatively simple way.
</p>
<p>
	I would apologize to the more experienced developers who feel patronized by this, I however enjoy augmenting my own fragile ego by destroying that of others. So no apologies.
</p>
<p>
	The instructions have been riddled with links to internal and external documentation. Some internal documentation has not been written yet. If you run into terminology you don't understand, but doesn't have a link to external documentation, I strongly recommend Googling it.
